## FAQs

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Q1: What do I do excel says there are circular references? | Go into preferences, choose calculation options and make sure the iteration box has a check in it. |
| Q2: My spreadsheet has gone crazy. I get errors all over. | I am sorry to say this, but you probably just made an input error. While you might have |
| What did I do wrong? | fixed it, the iterations in the spreadsheet make it very sensitive and the errors will not |
|  | go away. The only fix (Sorry, sorry…) is to copy the inputs into a fresh version of the spreadsheet. |
| Q3: I am entering the inputs for my company but the | You probably forgot to check the iteration box (see Q1) |
| optimal numbers do not seem to change from the |  |
| originals |  |
| Q4: I am getting an optimal debt ratio of 0%. This can't | Sure. If your operating income is either negative or very low, relative to your firm value, |
| be right. Can it? | you can end up at an optimal debt ratio of 0%. For instance, if you have EBIT of 100 on a |
|  | firm value of 10000, a 10% debt ratio would probably push you into a C rating and give |
|  | you a very high cost of capital. |
| Q5: My cost of capital at my optimal debt ratio is higher | Generally, you are right. However, I would suggest that you look at three factors: |
| than the current cost of capital. I thought it was supposed |  - If your optimal is just slightly higher or lower than your current debt ratio, it is possible that you |
| to be lower. | are closer to the optimal than the stated optimal. Let me explain. Assume that you are at a 24% debt ratio |
|  | and the optimal comes out to 30%. The true optimal is really somewhere around 30% since |
|  | I am constrained to work in 10% increments of the debt ratio. If the true optimal were |
|  | 26%, your current debt ratio of 24% is closer to the optimal. |
|  |  - Rating Differences: One of the costs of rating a company based only on the interest |
|  | coverage ratio is that the rating might be very different from the actual rating. Thus, your |
|  | current cost of capital is based upon your current rating, and the optimal is based upon |
|  | the synthetic ratings, and the two don't match, the current and the optimal cost of capital |
|  | can be mismatched. You can get around this by switching to a synthetic rating for computing |
|  | the current cost of capital (in the input sheet). |
|  |  - Existing debt at low rates: I assume in the spreadsheet that existing debt gets refinanced at |
|  | the new pre-tax cost of debt at each debt ratio. Consequently, if you have a lot of old debt on |
|  | your books at much lower rates, the interest expense that I report will be much higher than |
|  | your actual interest expense. This, in turn, can affect your interest coverage ratio and rating. |
|  | This, too, you can fix by locking in debt at current rates in the input sheet. |

## Inputs

| Inputs |

| Please enter the name of the company you are analyzing: |
| Financial Information |
| Earnings before long term interest expenses, depreciation & amortization |

| Book value of long term debt: |
| Can you estimate the market value of the long term debt? |
| If so, enter the market value of debt: |
| Do you want me to try and estimate market value of debt? |

| Do you want to assume that existing debt is refinanced at the 'new' rate? |
| Do you want the firm's current rating to be adjusted to the synthetic rating? |

## Operating leases

| Operating Lease Converter |
|---|
| Operating lease expenses are really financial expenses, and should be treated as such. Accounting standards allow them to |
| be treated as operating expenses. This program will convert commitments to make operating leases into debt and |
| adjust the operating income accordingly, by adding back the imputed interest expense on this debt. |
