|---|---|---|
| Company name | Airbnb | There should be a check against the iteration box. If there is not, you will get circular reasoning errors. |

| Do you have R&D expenses to capitalize? | No |  If you want to capitalize R&D, you have to input the numbers into the R&D worksheet.  |
| Do you have operating lease commitments? | No | If you have operating leases, please enter your lease commitments in the lease worksheet below and I will convert to debt |
| Cash and Marketable Securities | 8322.5 | 6391.3 |
| Cross holdings and other non-operating assets | 0 | 0 |
| Minority interests | 0 | 0 |
| Number of shares outstanding = | 642.8621684373461 | Counted RSUs |
| Current stock price = | 142.13 | Rumored price |
| Effective tax rate = | 0 |  |
| Marginal tax rate = | 0.25 |  |

| Operating Margin for next year | 0.1 |  |
| Compounded Gross Bookng growth rate - years 2-5 = | 0.2 | Growth Lever |
| Target Revenues as % of Gross Bookings | 0.14 |  |
| Target pre-tax operating margin (EBIT as % of sales in year 10) = | 0.25 | Profitability Lever |
| Year of convergence | 10 | Speed of convergence level |
| Sales to capital ratio  (for computing reinvestment) = | 2 | Efficency of Growth Lever |
| Market numbers  |  |  |
| Riskfree rate | 0.018 |  |
| Initial cost of capital = | 0.08608400566699682 |  |
| Other inputs |  |  |
| Do you have employee options outstanding? | Yes |  |

| Average strike price = | 11.43 |  |
| Average maturity = | 5 |  |
| Standard deviation on stock price = | 0.4 |  |
| Default assumptions.  |  |  |
| In stable growth, I will assume that your firm will have a cost of capital similar to that of typical mature companies (riskfree rate + 4.5%) |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | No | Mature companies generally see their risk levels approach the average |
| If yes, enter the cost of capital after year 10 = | 0.075 | Though some sectors, even in stable growth, may have higher risk. If you change your risk free rate after year 10 (see cell B57 & 58), you should incorporate it into your stable cost of capital estimate. |
| I will assume that your firm will earn a return on capital equal to its cost of capital after year 10. I am assuming that whatever competitive advantages you have today will fade over time. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | Yes | Mature companies find it difficult to generate returns that exceed the cost of capital |
| If yes, enter the return on capital you expect after year 10 | 0.1 | But there are significant exceptions among companies with long-lasting competitive advantages. |
| I will assume that your firm has no chance of failure over the foreseeable future. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | Yes | Many young, growth companies fail, especially if they have trouble raising cash. Many distressed companies fail, because they have trouble making debt payments. |
| If yes, enter the probability of failure = | 0.05 | Tough to estimate but a key input. |
| What do you want to tie your proceeds in failure to? | V | B: Book value of capital, V= Estimated fair value for the company |
| Enter the distress proceeds as percentage of book or fair value | 0.5 | This can be zero, if the assets will be worth nothing if the firm fails. |
| I will assume that your effective tax rate will adjust to your marginal tax rate by your terminal year. If you override this assumption, I will leave the tax rate at your effective tax rate. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | No |  |
| I will assume that you have no losses carried forward from prior years ( NOL) coming into the valuation. If you have a money losing company, you may want to override tis. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | Yes | Check the financial statements. |
| If yes, enter the NOL that you are carrying over into year 1 | 167600 | An NOL will shield your income from taxes, even after you start making money. |
| I will asssume that today's risk free rate will prevail in perpetuity. If you override this assumption, I will change the riskfree rate after year 10. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | Yes | If yes, you will be asked to enter a normal risk free rate and your growth in perpetuity will be adjusted accordingly. |
| If yes, enter the riskfree rate after year 10 | 0.02 | Enter your estimate of what the riskfree rate (in your currency of choice) will be after year 10 |
| I will assume that the growth rate in perpetuity will be equal to the risk free rate. This allows for both valuation consistency and prevents "impossible" growth rates. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption = | No | This is an option to let you use a negative growth rate in perpetuity or to even liquidate the firm. |
| If yes, enter the growth rate in perpetuity | -0.05 | This can be negative, if you feel the company will decline (and disappear) after growth is done. If you let it exceed the risk free rate, you are on your own in uncharted territory. |
| I have assumed that none of the cash is trapped (in foreign countries) and that there is no additional tax liability coming due and that cash is a neutral asset. |  |  |
| Do you want to override this assumption | No |  |
| If yes, enter trapped cash (if taxes) or entire balance (if mistrust) | 140000 | Cash that is trapped in foreign markets (and subject to additoinal tax) or cash that is being discounted by the market (because of management mistrust) |
| & Average tax rate of the foreign markets where the cash is trapped | 0.15 | Additional tax rate due on trapped cash or discount being applied to cash balance because of mistrust. |

## Stories to Numbers

| Airbnb | 2021-02-01 00:00:00 |
|---|---|
| The Story |  |
| Airbnb has brought the sharing economy to housing, connecting home owners (hosts) who own units or houses that they want to rent with renters (guests) online, collecting a percentage of the transaction revenues from both sides of the transaction. Its low capital intensity model and extended reach has allowed it to expand   not only to expand to almost every part of the world (220 countries) but also provide an unmatched range of offerings. The growth in gross bookings has started to slow down, as the company gets bigger, and the COVID shut downs made 2020 a regressive year. That said, as its competitors in the hotel business have been damaged far more by the crisis, Airbnb will be able to recover quickly from the crisis, and continue on its growth path. Economies of scale will allow for only mild improvements in revenues as a % of gross billings, but the brokerage-based business will generate high margins, in steady state, and require relatively little reinvestment. |  |
| The Assumptions |  |
|  | Link to story |
| Gross Bookings & Growth Rate | Growth continues, as hotels scale back growth plans after COVID shock. |
| Revenues as % of Gross Bookings | Mild economies of scale allow slight increase in percent over time |
| Operating margin (b) | Higher margins than the hotel business, but lower than ad driven businesses. |
| Tax rate | Global/US marginal tax rate, after NOLs are used up. |
| Reinvestment (c ) | Low capital intensity business |
| Return on capital | Networking benefits allow for high value growth |
| Cost of capital (d) | Cost of capital moves up over time. |

## Cost of capital worksheet

| You can use this spreadsheet to compute your cost of capital. You can either use the built-in data to compute key inputs (beta, equity risk premium, default spread) or enter them directly. If you choose to use the built in ERP data, you can update the ERP numbers to reflect a more current mature market premuum (since the spreadsheet uses the start of the year numbers). |
